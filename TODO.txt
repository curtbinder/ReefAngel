TODO List (in no particular order)
----------------------------------
* Create Setup Functions
   + MH Time
   + MH Time Delay
   + Std Lights Time
   + Heater Temp Setup
   + Chiller Temp Setup
   + Overheat Temp Setup 
   + LED PWM Setup
   + Wavemaker Setup
   - Dosing Pump Setup
   + Feeding Mode Timer
   + Screensaver Timeout
   + ATO Timeout
   + ph Calibration
   + Date / Time
* Ability to assign a function to a specific port
* Associate Timers to specific port
* Fix DrawOption to display a decimal point one digit in if subunit is given
* Have sanity check for reading/writing values to memory (ensure value is within range)
* Have default values programmed in for variables
* Ability to have dosing pumps repeat every X seconds/hours instead of having a set time.  Pump could run ever 30minutes, 1hour, etc.
* Add ATO Timeout Clear for Low & High switches instead of 1
* Test wavemaker interval to have 0 equal always on
* IFDEF out various sections of the code
** Metal Halides Setup (Lights & Delay)
** ATO (Timeout Set & Clear & Menu)

Completed Items
---------------
* DrawOption should not draw extra spaces if no unit & subunit are given
* Fix Menu navigation on main branch to work properly when selecting an item at any level below the main menu (should be working in NestedMenusFunctions.pde file)
* Test SingleATO timeout function
* Implement SingleATO time limitation
* Ability to load values from memory (on startup/change)
* Have specific designation for Feeding, Screensaver, SaveParams Timer
* Improve DrawOption to limit the width of the clear box
* Finish SetupLightsOptionsDisplay - get : between hours & minutes, align time properly on screen
* Check on setup displays using bytes (uint8_t) and range checks with negative numbers.
* Remove EEPROM class altogether, incorporate that class into my ReefAngel_EEPROM class
* IFDEF out various sections of the code
** Wavemaker Setup
** DosingPump Setup
** Date / Time Setup
** Version Display
** LED PWM (all references)
