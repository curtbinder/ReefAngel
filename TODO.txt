TODO List (in no particular order)
----------------------------------
* Cleanup/Better handle timers (use of class timer)
* Add in AlternateFont
* Test / Incorporate new dsWire library
* Document ALL functions using Doxygen...auto-generation of documentation will be easy then.
* Investigate occassional graph line drawing quirks
	- lines don't always get drawn completely
	- sometimes the line gets drawn on 2 rows
	- outline for the relay box sometimes has extra line above it
	- corrects itself by viewing the menu and exiting the menu
	- odd

Completed Items
---------------
* DrawOption should not draw extra spaces if no unit & subunit are given
* Fix Menu navigation on main branch to work properly when selecting an item at any level below the main menu (should be working in NestedMenusFunctions.pde file)
* Test SingleATO timeout function
* Implement SingleATO time limitation
* Ability to load values from memory (on startup/change)
* Have specific designation for Feeding, Screensaver, SaveParams Timer
* Improve DrawOption to limit the width of the clear box
* Finish SetupLightsOptionsDisplay - get : between hours & minutes, align time properly on screen
* Check on setup displays using bytes (uint8_t) and range checks with negative numbers.
* Remove EEPROM class altogether, incorporate that class into my ReefAngel_EEPROM class
* IFDEF out various sections of the code
    + Wavemaker Setup
    + DosingPump Setup
    + Date / Time Setup
    + Version Display
    + LED PWM (all references)
    + Metal Halides Setup (Lights & Delay)
    + ATO (Timeout Set & Clear & Menu)
* Create Setup Functions
    + MH Time
    + MH Time Delay
    + Std Lights Time
    + Heater Temp Setup
    + Chiller Temp Setup
    + Overheat Temp Setup 
    + LED PWM Setup
    + Wavemaker Setup
    + Dosing Pump Setup
    + Feeding Mode Timer
    + Screensaver Timeout
    + ATO Timeout
    + ph Calibration
    + Date / Time
* Added in more comments about IFDEFs, give some approximate sizes in bytes about how much each section will add to the overall compile size
* Trim down compiled size by 252 or more bytes to allow ALL functionality at same time (except wifi, feeding timer setup, screensaver timer setup, overheat setup)
* Have default values programmed in for variables (Use SetInternalMemory Sketch)
* Add in EEPROM functions
	+ ATOHourInterval (byte, low switch)
	+ ATOHighHourInterval (byte, high switch)
	+ ATOHighTimeout (byte, high switch timeout)
* Add in Hour Interval setup screen
* ifdef for Single ATO usage (SingleATO)
	+ switches ATO Timeout page to dual configuration
	+ adds in ATO Hour Interval page
* ifdef for Standard Lights (StandardLightSetup)
* ifdef for removal of ALL lighting controls (RemoveAllLights)
* Improve SetInternalMemory
	- Incorporate all memory locations
	- Split displaying values on to 2 screens with a 2+ second interval between screens
* Feeding/Water mode toggle, can specify what ports get turned on & off during water change mode and feeding mode by setting appropriate bits in byte variables
* If Temp reads 0, do not turn on heater

Wish List 
(Features that would be nice, but aren't necessary and will cause the compile size to increase)
----------
* Fix DrawOption to display a decimal point one digit from right
* Ability to assign a function to a specific port
* Associate Timers to specific port
* Have sanity check for reading/writing values to memory (ensure value is within range)
* Ability to have dosing pumps repeat every X seconds/hours instead of having a set time.  Pump could run ever 30minutes, 1hour, etc.
* Add ATO Timeout Clear for Low & High switches instead of 1
